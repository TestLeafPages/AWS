Hi Team,

Choose any one region - eg. mumbai, singapore

1. Launch *Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM)*, SSD Volume Type [Free Tier]
2. Choose Instance Type as t2.micro, 
3. Create a new KeyPair for Linux and download it
4. Configure Security Group to allow ports no (SSH-22, HTTP-80) and set Source to anywhere 
5. Confirm the Linux is up and running in Dashboard

Process to connect Ec2 instance

1. open command line type the following command 

   Syntax: ssh -i "path of pem file/pemfile.pem" ec2-user@public-ip

   EG: ssh -i test.pem ec2-user@13.121.346.124

Run following commands one by one to install apache 

sudo -i
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
cd /var/www/html
echo "<h1>Hello World from EC2 Linux Instance $(hostname -f)</h1>" > index.html

Finally, go the public ip from your chrome

http://<your linux public ip>  Eg. http://13.45.67.89

That confirms you apache httpd is up and running in Linux.
